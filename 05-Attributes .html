1.The href Attribute 
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example
<a href="https://www.aftabuddin.com">Visit </a>

2.The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg">

3.The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

4.The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

5.The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

6.The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
The following example specifies English as the language:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
  
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

7.The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
